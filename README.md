# TicTacToe

My own version of Tic Tac Toe using a minimax algorithm in Javascript.
Play the game [here](https://rushmyers.github.io/TicTacToe/). 

# About

Just a simple game of tic-tac-toe. The minimax algorithm is used to select which move the AI makes. It goes through every possible move it could make and all the ways the game could go based off of that move, and picks the best one. This means you can't win! The best you can do is tie.

# Future Development

- Add in a game difficulty option. This would give the player to select between two game modes: Hard and Easy. In easy, perhaps the AI will simply select an open tile randomly. The current state will become hard mode.
